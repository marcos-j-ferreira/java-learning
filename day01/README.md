# First Day

On this first day, I aimed to review some important topics in *Java*, focusing on understanding the syntax and usage. I didn't have to start from scratch, as I already have some prior knowledge of the language.

### Topics Covered

* *Scanner:* I tried to understand how data input works in Java, applying it in a few code blocks.
* *Loops:* This was mostly a review, since loops are very similar to those in *C*, with only a few differences.
* *Condition:* I went over logical operators again, though I’m already familiar with them.
* *Array and Array02:* Not yet completed, but I started studying arrays, as they are one of the main data structures in Java.

### Project 

* *Note:* This project was for learning purposes, meant to help me consolidate and get more familiar with Java. It's nothing extraordinary.
