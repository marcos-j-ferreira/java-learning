## Second Day

On this day, I was able to expand my knowledge horizon. I studied important data control structures, improved my understanding of function types, and began learning about classes.

### Topics Covered

* **Variables:** I already had some knowledge in this area, so I just reviewed the concepts of `public`, `private`, and their scopes and ranges.
* **String:** I tried to understand how strings work in Java and whether they follow the same logic as in other languages.
* **Functions:** As with variables, I already had a general idea about functions in Java—this was just to better understand their structure.
* **Classes:** I introduced myself to the core of Java—classes and objects. I managed to explore this topic quite well.

### Project – `Simple Login System`

* **Note:** In this project, I tried to apply everything I had studied so far. Since I didn’t have much time, I kept it simple.

#### About

This project uses a default username and password. When the user enters their credentials, the system checks if they are correct and returns whether the login was successful.
