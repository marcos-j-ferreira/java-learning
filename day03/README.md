## Third Day

Today I studied **classes** in Java — the heart of the language. I reviewed different types of classes, created examples, and built a small project to apply what I learned.

### Topics

* **Abstract Classes:**
  I created a simple abstract class and another class that implemented its methods. I used `@Override` to redefine methods, and in the main method, I created objects and called them.

  ---

  * *Note:* Keywords involved: `abstract`, `extends`, and `@Override`.

  ---

* **Encapsulation:**
  This concept helps protect the internal data of a class. All variables were set to `private`, and I used methods (getters/setters) to access or modify them. I didn’t use constructors here.

  ---

  * *Note:* There are no specific keywords for encapsulation—it’s more about how you implement it in your code.

  ---

* **Inheritance:**
  This allows a class to reuse methods from another class, making the code more concise and organized.

  ---

  * *Note:* The keyword `extends` is used to inherit methods from another class.

  ---

* **Interface:**
  I created an `interface` with method definitions, then implemented those methods in another class, adding variables and logic as needed.

  ---

  * *Note:* Keywords involved: `interface` and `implements`.

  ---

* **Polymorphism:**
  I practiced rewriting methods from a parent class in a child class using `@Override`. This is useful for creating flexible and cleaner code.

  ---

  * *Note:* Like before, the `@Override` annotation is used when redefining methods in a new class.

  ---

### Project – `Cadastro`

* **Note:** A very simple project using classes. I kept the code short and focused. In the coming weeks, I plan to build more advanced projects using these concepts.
