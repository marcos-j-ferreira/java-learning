### ðŸ“˜ Day 1 Summary

Focused on reviewing the basics of Java, including syntax, input handling with `Scanner`, loops, conditionals, and an introduction to arrays. Completed a simple calculator project (`Calculator.java`) to reinforce learning. Already had prior knowledge, so the focus was on practice and consolidation.
