# java-learning
The goal of this repository is to contain all the code from my Java studies.

---

### 📘 Day 1 Summary

Focused on reviewing the basics of Java, including syntax, input handling with `Scanner`, loops, conditionals, and an introduction to arrays. Completed a simple calculator project (`Calculator.java`) to reinforce learning. Already had prior knowledge, so the focus was on practice and consolidation.

### 📘 Day 2 Summary

Expanded knowledge in Java by reviewing access modifiers (`public`, `private`) and scopes. Studied string handling, function structure, and had a solid introduction to classes and objects—the core of Java. Applied concepts in a basic login system project (`SimpleLogin.java`) using default credentials to validate user input.

### 📘 Day 3 Summary

Learned core object-oriented programming concepts in Java: **abstract classes**, **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **interfaces**, and **polymorphism**. Created examples and a small project (`Cadastro`) to apply these concepts. The day focused on understanding how Java structures code around classes and how to organize reusable, maintainable logic.

## Compile 

To use two or more classes in Java at the same time, you need to compile these classes. You have two options: compile all classes or choose specific ones to compile.

* `javac [names of files]` — Command to compile specific classes.
* `javac *.java` — Compiles all `.java` files in your project.

### Observation

It is recommended to use **Gradle** or **Maven** in larger projects for compiling, as they help reduce the chance of bugs or errors.
