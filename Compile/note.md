## Compile 

To use two or more classes in Java at the same time, you need to compile these classes. You have two options: compile all classes or choose specific ones to compile.

* `javac [names of files]` — Command to compile specific classes.
* `javac *.java` — Compiles all `.java` files in your project.

### Observation

It is recommended to use **Gradle** or **Maven** in larger projects for compiling, as they help reduce the chance of bugs or errors.
